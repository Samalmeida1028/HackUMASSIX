# HackUMASSIX

Organisers: Samuel, Tirth, Arjun and Chinguun

In this project, we build a MORSE code detector that takes in light pulses or sound pulses as input and compares that to the MORSE database to output a message in English.

The programming is all done in Python using the PyCharm IDE, and components for the light pulses and sound pulses are a photodiode sensor and a mic wired to a low pass filter to filter out white noise.

In addition, the Arduino IDE and stepper motors are used to simplify the hardware to software process down.
